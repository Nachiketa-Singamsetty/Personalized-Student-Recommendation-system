## Approach

1. **Data Fetching**:
   - Quiz data is retrieved from API endpoints and converted into DataFrames.
   
2. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Calculates accuracy and identifies weak topics using historical quiz data.
   - Visualizes accuracy trends and topic-wise performance.

3. **Student Persona**:
   - Categorizes students based on their average accuracy and speed.

4. **Machine Learning**:
   - Trains a Random Forest model to predict performance based on quiz features.
   - Generates AI-driven recommendations.

5. **Recommendations**:
   - Provides suggestions for weak areas, tailored study plans, and AI-driven advice.
